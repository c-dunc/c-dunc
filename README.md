Hi there! My name is Callum and I'm a security enthusiast, Linux enthusiast, and boxer.

On my GitHub, you'll find a collection of projects that I have created to solve problems that I've encountered or ideas 
I have had! These projects may be useful to other people in one way or another, so feel free to take a look around 
and see if there's anything that interests you. 

In my free time, I enjoy staying up to date with the latest developments in the security and Linux worlds. I am constantly
learning  and looking for ways to improve my skills. I am also an avid boxer and enjoy staying fit and active. I enjoy 
challenging myself with security and Linux tasks, and I have been making my way through the rooms on Tryhackme, constantly 
learning and improving my skills.
